# mtree specification

## background

XXX BSD things 

It is worth noting here that there are multiple tools for creating and validating a filesystem against a manifest.
While a few of them are noted, this specifcaion is *not* on the tools behaviour, but rather the format of the mtree manifest.

Options are:
* BSD original
* linux port of the BSD tool
* go-mtree/cmd/gomtree
* libarchive output format

## manifest format

TODO: document the old bsd, new bsd, and the extensions done in go-mtree
